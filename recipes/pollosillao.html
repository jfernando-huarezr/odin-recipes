    <p><img src="../images/pollosillao/1.png" alt="pollo al sillao"></p>
    <h3>Chicken in soy sauce, one of my favorites: roasted chicken thighs with soy sauce, garlic and ginger, served with roasted sweet potatos and fluffy white rice  to mop up the flavorful juices</h3>

    <p>Chicken in soy sauce is one if not the most delicious dish I have ever eaten. It's one
       those dishes you remember from your childhood. What's even better, it is really easy to make!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 chicken thighs</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, sliced or grated</li>
            <li>1 lime</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger, grated</li>
            <li>½ cup Kikkoman soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup honey</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the chicken in a pyrex. I use the skin because it protects the flesh in the oven, but you can use skinned chicken.</li>
            <li>Season with garlic, lime zest, lime juice, and ginger.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl combine Kikkoman soy sauce and honey, and season the chicken with this mixture. Cover and marinate overnight or at least for one hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375ºF.</li>
            <li>Uncover the chicken, add water and bake for one hour, basting every 20 minutes with the juices. The chicken should have a beautiful brown color.</li>
        </ol>
